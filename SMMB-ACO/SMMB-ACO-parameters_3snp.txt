# Maximal number of iterations allowed to learn one Markov blanket, #for one given large subset K, to escape the issue of non-modified MB.
# If the sampling of k variables among K variables does not allow to #identify a candidate subset s which is actually added to the growing #MB, then the MB would not be modified and learnMB (inner level #procedure of SMMB algorithm) would stop.
# To palliate this problem, one coerces the exploration of the subset #of K variables through max_trials_learn_mb.
